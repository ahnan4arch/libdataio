    - Modified pcmseq2_write.c to compute currenttime using gettimeofday()
        instead of time(). The result of this is that the saved time has
        a resolution of microseconds rather than seconds.
    - Added PCMIO_GETTIMEFRACTION and PCMIO_SETTIMEFRACTION.  These will
        get and set the time in microseconds (on top of the time in seconds
        read/written by PCMIO_GETTIME and PCMIO_SETTIME.  Together, SETTIME
        and SETTIMEFRACTION, allow one to set the time of a pcmseq2 entry
        to microsecond precision.  Other file formats (wav, raw, pcmfix)
        do not support this level of precision.

    - Removed the esps feasd support from pcmio (moved pcmfeasd.c into the
        subdirectory obsolete).
    - Moved libdataio out of saber and aplot, and put it into it's own
        package.
    - Changed the license to GPL

    - Major addition: added a video datatype.  Thus, there's a new header
        file, vidio.h, and new functions, vid_open, vid_close, etc.
        The only supported video data file right now is .avi files. These
        must be the .avi files that are written by saber, which contain
        some extra information (per-frame time stamps) in JUNK headers
        that are ignored by normal avi file players.  This code is going
        to be used by aplot, etc, to play video files recorded by saber.
        Later, I'll also add avi file writing support.
    - Note that the video code requires linking with libjpeg. (saber writes
        jpeg compressed frames)
    - There's a very rudimentary testvidio test program.

    - Fixed creation of .wav files for big-endian machines.  The data was
        not being sex-converted (though the header was being written
        correctly).
    - Fixed up the detection of big-endian architectures.  I now include
        endian.h, which is provided by glibc, and check for
        __BYTE_ORDER == __BIG_ENDIAN.  Before, I was just doing ifdef for
        sun or SGI
    - Big-endian machines should now be able to read .exp_idx files.
    - Big-endian machines should now be able to correctly write .pcm_fix.
    - Big-endian machines should now be able to correctly read/write
        .pcm_seq2 files.
    - Now, all .pcm files are treated as containing little-endian samples.
        Thus, big-endian machines should be able to read/write .pcm files
        that were created or that can be read by little-endian machines.
        By forcing this convention, it also means that the millions of
        existing .pcm files can be read by big and little endian machines
        without worry.

    - Writing out wav files only worked when pcm_write() was called once,
        with the entire entry's worth of samples. I've now fixed it so
        one can stream data into .wav files.

12/13/05
    - Added support for reading .mp3 files, with decoding provided
        by MAD (MPEG Audio Decoder - available from
        <http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/>), which must be installed.
        If this support is wanted, then uncomment the MP3_* stuff in the
        Makefile, and make sure to link any applications with libmad
        (i.e., -lmad).  Feature requested by Eric Fortune.  Note that
        channels (left, right, etc. are accessed as entries 1, 2, etc.)
