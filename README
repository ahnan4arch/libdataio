    1.  What is it?
    ---------------

       Dataio is a library that presents a common interface for reading
       and writing various types of data commonly encountered in a
       neuronal/acoustic data acquisition setting.  Three types of data
       are specifically handled:

        PCM - pulse coded modulation,
            i.e. raw waveforms from an analog-digital converter
        LBL - events, such as the times at which stimuli are presented,
            or a manually or automatically generated parsing of the
            temporal sequence of animal/etc behaviors.  For vocalizations,
            this can record the identity and onset/offset of specific
            syllables, etc.
        TOE - time-of-event
            For storing the times of occurence of neuronal action potentials 

       This library is specifically used by several of my programs:
        saber - data acquisition
        aplot - offline data visualization/analysis/figure generation
        pcmx - pcm data conversion, processing, manipulation, playing, etc.
        pcmstat - simple statistics 
        toex - time of event data conversion, processing, etc.
        toestat - simple statistics
        aquery - flat-file database query
        ...others...

    4.  REQUIREMENTS
    ----------------
        ...


    5.  INSTALL
    -----------
        The following should work (:->):
            $ make clean
            $ make depend
            $ make
        This should build libdataio.a as well as some test programs.
        I don't get a single gcc warning, so I'm very interested in
        hearing about problems.
        Editing the Makefile might be necessary.

        You should 'make install' the library as root before using it.
